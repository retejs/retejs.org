## Install dependencies {#install-dependencies}

:kit

```bash
npm i rete-connection-path-plugin d3-shape
```

## Plugin connection {#connect-plugin}

The `curveStep` method is used for all connections in this example. Keep in mind that the plugin must be linked to the render plugin, which must emit the `connectionpath` event.

```ts
import { ConnectionPathPlugin } from "rete-connection-path-plugin";
import { curveStep } from "d3-shape";

const pathPlugin = new ConnectionPathPlugin<Schemes, Area2D<Schemes>>({
  curve: () => curveStep
});

render.use(pathPlugin);
```

## Connection-specific path {#connection-specific}

The `curve` option takes a callback function with the connection instance as the first parameter, allowing you to customize the path type.

```ts
import { curveStep, curveMonotoneX, curveLinear, CurveFactory } from "d3-shape";

class Connection extends ClassicPreset.Connection<
  ClassicPreset.Node,
  ClassicPreset.Node
> {
  curve?: CurveFactory;
}

const pathPlugin = new ConnectionPathPlugin<Schemes, Area2D<Schemes>>({
  curve: (connection) => connection.curve || curveStep
});

const monotoneConnection = new Connection(a, "port", b, "port");
const linearConnection = new Connection(a, "port", b, "port");

monotoneConnection.curve = curveMonotoneX;
linearConnection.curve = curveLinear;
```
