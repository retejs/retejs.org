# Magnetic connection

The given example showcases a technique to enhance UX by enlarging the connection dropping area. This means that users do not have to aim directly at the socket to make a connection, particularly when the socket is small or the zoom level is low.

:kit
:example{id="rete-js-v2-magnetic-connection-078ild" module="/src/editor.ts"}

In order to implement this strategy in your project, just copy the `magnetic-connection` directory and the corresponding `useMagneticConnection` function call in the `editor.ts` module. Depending on the rendering plugin you are using, you can either use the existing component from the directory or create your own.
