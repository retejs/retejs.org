This example demonstrates the use of a context menu presented as a separate plugin. It allows for the creation of a common context menu with a list of nodes to be created (including nested sub-items), as well as individual context menus for nodes with options for deletion and copying.

The provided functionality relies on a classic preset, but for enhanced customization, it can be substituted to facilitate more dynamic menu item generation.
