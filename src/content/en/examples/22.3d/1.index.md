With the [`rete-area-3d-plugin`](https://github.com/retejs/area-3d-plugin) plugin, the native HTML editor can be seamlessly integrated into 3D scene without compromising interactive capabilities with nodes and other editor components.

Based on **Three.js**, this scene uses `Sky` and `Water` modules (can be found in [the official example](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_shaders_ocean.html)) to showcase the visual effect of integrated nodes and connections on a 3D environment.
