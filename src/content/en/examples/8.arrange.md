Automated node arrangement, or commonly referred to as layouting, enables the positioning of nodes in relation to each other, considering their connections. This is achieved through a specialized plugin that utilizes [elk.js](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) to calculate node positions.

Additionally, it offers extensive customization capabilities, allowing users to configure node placement through various options and an applier to assign the calculated positions to nodes (e.g incorporating animations).
