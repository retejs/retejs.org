The following example demonstrates the implementation of custom nodes, sockets, and connections for **React.js**, allowing you to adapt them to your use cases. These elements can be dynamically configured based on the parameters of various objects (nodes, sockets, connections).

Additionally, a grid-like gradient background has been added using pure JS and CSS. Custom components visualized with **React.js** can be used independently of your tech stack, even [without JSX](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement). Therefore, if your UI framework lacks integration, you can render parts of the editor using **React.js**, leveraging this example.
