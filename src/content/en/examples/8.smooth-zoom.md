# Smooth zoom

::

The editor comes with instant zoom enabled by default, with a step equivalent to one scroll wheel movement. If you require customization of this behavior, you can extend the `Zoom` class

:kit
:example{id="rete-js-v2-smooth-zoom-6sqv8j" module="/src/editor.ts"}

Within this example, the core logic is contained in `src/zoom.ts`. To integrate it into the editor, just include the following line:

```ts
area.area.setZoomHandler(new SmoothZoom(0.5, 200, "cubicBezier(.45,.91,.49,.98)", area));
```
