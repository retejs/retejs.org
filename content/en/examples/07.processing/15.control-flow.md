This example showcases an executing of schema via control flow using `rete-engine`, where each node dynamically decides which of its outgoing nodes will receive control.

Each node features an `execute` method that takes an input port key as a control source, and a function for conveying control to outgoing nodes through a defined output port. To initiate the execution of the flow, you can use `engine.execute` method, specifying the identifier of the starting node. Consequently, the outgoing nodes will be executed sequentially, starting from the designated node.
