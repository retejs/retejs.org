Node selection can be done not only through clicking but also by utilizing a flexible selector system, enabling you to expand it and select nodes by drawing a lasso or rectangle, for instance. The nodes that intersect with the drawn shape will be selected.

In this particular example, you have the option to switch between a selection button, a highlighting shape and an intersecting area of the node.

Although this example was originally designed for React.js, the showcased feature is completely framework-agnostic. You can seamlessly integrate it into your application on a different stack by copying the feature module and connecting it into your editor.
