This example demonstrates the implementation of panning the area when the cursor with a dragged node is approaches the editor's boundary. Depending on the distance to any of the area's boundaries, starting from a certain threshold, the panning speed will be inversely proportional to the distance to the boundary.

Although this example was originally designed for React.js, the showcased feature is completely framework-agnostic. You can seamlessly integrate it into your application on a different stack by copying the feature module and connecting it into your editor.
