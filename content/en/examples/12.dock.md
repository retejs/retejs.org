Dock menu is a section with a list of nodes that users can add to the editor by clicking or dragging. In the default preset, this menu is placed at the bottom of the editor, but you can create your own preset with custom styles. Furthermore, you can dynamically add or remove nodes from this list, configuring them with the desired properties and specifying their order
