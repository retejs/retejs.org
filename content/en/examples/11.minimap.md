By default, a minimap is placed in the bottom-right corner and features rectangles that represent the positions of nodes and the viewport. All nodes added in the editor are dynamically displayed on the minimap, ensuring that they are all within the minimap's boundaries. Additionally, you can change the viewport's position by dragging its mini- viewport.
