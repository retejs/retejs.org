This editor showcases one of the 3D features mentioned in [the guide](/docs/guides/3d#multiple-editors), specifically the capability of the `rete-area-3d-plugin` to integrate multiple editors within a single scene.

There are two types of editors available here: the materials editor (on the left) and the geometry editor (on the right). They are quite simple and designed for customizing the frame for the painting. Each editor has its own contextual menu. You can navigate the scene in two ways: through pointer capture mode or orbital control mode, which also allows you to edit schemes.

Although this example was originally designed for React.js, the showcased feature is completely framework-agnostic. You can seamlessly integrate it into your application on a different stack by copying the feature module and connecting it into your editor.
