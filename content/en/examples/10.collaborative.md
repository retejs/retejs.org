# Collaborative

This example demonstrates a real-time collaborative node editor where multiple users can work on the same graph simultaneously. The implementation includes:

- Real-time synchronization of node and connection changes
- Live cursor tracking and user presence indicators

The collaborative features are built using the Broadcast Channel API, enabling efficient real-time communication between multiple browser tabs or windows, ensuring smooth multi-user interactions without compromising the editor's performance.

Although this example was originally designed for React.js, the showcased feature is completely framework-agnostic. You can seamlessly integrate it into your application on a different stack by copying the feature module and connecting it into your editor.
