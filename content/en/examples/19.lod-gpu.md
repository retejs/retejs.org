This example represents an improved version of [the LOD example](/examples/lod), allowing the visualization of thousands of nodes within a single editor. The improvement lies in rendering simplified versions of nodes and connections on the canvas, utilizing the GPU through [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com), whenever rendering the original node becomes unreasonable due to its small on-screen size.

Once the user zooms in, the original node is rendered at an appropriate level of detail, enabling user interaction.

Although this example was originally designed for React.js, the showcased feature is completely framework-agnostic. You can seamlessly integrate it into your application on a different stack by copying the feature module and connecting it into your editor.
