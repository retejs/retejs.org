Within this example, you can set the number of nodes to be displayed and assess the performance during their rendering. Given that visualizing a large number of elements on a page always comes with performance issues, you can explore examples such as [LOD](/examples/lod) and [LOD GPU](/examples/lod-gpu) using specialized approaches to mitigate these limitations
