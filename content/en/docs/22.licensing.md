# Licensing

The MIT license applied to most framework packages permits you to use them without any limitations in personal and commercial projects alike.

Certain plugins are classified as advanced and currently have only a CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license. These include:
- [rete-structures](https://github.com/retejs/structures)
- [rete-scopes-plugin](https://github.com/retejs/scopes-plugin)


They plugins are freely available for use in personal, non-commercial projects. Commercial use is currently not permitted due to the absence of a dual licensing model. However, as this functionality isn't primary, you are free to utilize other available features of the framework and develop additional custom solution.
