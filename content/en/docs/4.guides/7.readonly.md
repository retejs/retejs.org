## Install dependencies {#install-dependencies}

```bash
npm i rete-readonly-plugin
```

## Plugin connection {#connect-plugin}

```ts
import { ReadonlyPlugin } from "rete-readonly-plugin";

const readonly = new ReadonlyPlugin<Schemes>();

editor.use(readonly.root);
editor.use(area);
area.use(readonly.area);
area.use(render);
```

Make sure to follow the order to connect `readonly.root` and `readonly.area` before any other plugins.

## Enable {#enable}

The plugin allows modifications to the editor by default, giving you the ability to establish the editor's initial appearance using methods such as `addNode`.

Use the following code to activate it:

```ts
readonly.enable();
```

## Disable {#disable}

Disabling can be done in a similar way:

```ts
readonly.disable();
```

## Controls {#controls}

When referring to the in-built controls provided by the framework, like `ClassicPreset.InputControl`, it's important to specify the readonly feature individually in the below manner:

```ts
new ClassicPreset.InputControl('text', { readonly: true })
```

Since other controls can be custom, it is up to the developer to implement their "read-only" capability.

## Disable connection manipulation {#disable-connection-manipulation}

Finally, if you have completed the [Basic](/docs/guides/basic) guide, make sure to remove the `ConnectionPlugin` import.

```ts
area.use(connection); // should be removed
```

Check out the complete result on the [Readonly](/examples/readonly) example page.
