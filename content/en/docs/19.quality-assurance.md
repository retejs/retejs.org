# Quality assurance

There are two kinds of tests in this project - unit and E2E

Unit tests are used to test individual modules within a package. While this approach is fast, it doesn't guarantee that the entire product functions correctly from a user's perspective.

On the other hand, E2E tests enable comprehensive testing of the product from the user's point of view. We rely on **Playwright** for E2E testing, which is integrated into `rete-qa` package and comes equipped with a set of UI tests for basic framework features.

Guidelines for writing tests:

- **keep it simple**: create tests that are easy to write and read
- **don't focus too much on code coverage metrics**: use them as reference but avoid drawing conclusions solely based on test coverage %
- **test one thing at a time**: this will help you locate issues more easily
- **cover edge cases**: ensures reliability of tests

## Rete QA tool {#rete-qa}

The main purpose of this tool is to conduct regression UI testing on different combinations of supported features, which are presented as individual packages and various integrations with UI frameworks.

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) serves as the underlying technology for this testing tool and enables it to conduct tests in three different browser types: **Chromium**, **Firefox**, **WebKit**.

Additionally, we test our framework on various versions of commonly used UI frameworks, such as Angular, Svelte, Vue.js, and React.js. This gives us **51** test runs across different environments as we have a matrix of browsers and framework versions

### Installation {#install}

```bash
npm i -g rete-qa
```

Don't forget to install the additional system dependencies as per the [Playwright's instructions](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#introduction).

### Initialization {#init}

Run the command and wait until the projects are generated for various frameworks and their dependencies are installed

```bash
rete-qa init --deps-alias dependencies.json
```

where `dependencies.json` (optional) is a JSON file, which should contain a mapping of dependencies

Dependencies are typically installed from npmjs using `latest` tag, but you can specify a different version by providing `name@version` or path to the tarball. For example, you can substitute a plugin with your own version of the plugin that has not yet been published

```json
{
  "my-rete-plugin": "../my-plugin/my-rete-plugin-1.0.0.tgz"
}
```

### Run tests {#run-tests}

Run the tests for provided stacks (**React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte**) and different browsers (**Chromium**, **Firefox**, **WebKit**)

```bash
rete-qa test
```
