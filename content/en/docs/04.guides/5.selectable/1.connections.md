## Getting types ready

Introducing an optional `selected` field to the connection type will allow us to specify programmatically added connections as selected

```ts
class Connection extends ClassicPreset.Connection<
  ClassicPreset.Node,
  ClassicPreset.Node
> {
  selected?: boolean;
}

type Schemes = GetSchemes<ClassicPreset.Node, Connection>;
```

## Custom connection

Our first step is to implement a custom connection that is clickable and capable of changing color when selected.

We will start with the [Connection.tsx](https://github.com/retejs/react-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components/Connection.tsx) component from the classic preset and enhance its functionality by implementing new features.

We can make the connection more user-friendly by defining a duplicating transparent path.

```ts
import styled from "styled-components";

const HoverPath = styled.path`
  fill: none;
  stroke-width: 15px;
  pointer-events: auto;
  stroke: transparent;
`;
```

We will enhance the existing `Path` component by adding a `selected` prop and modifying the stroke color.

```ts
const Path = styled.path<{ selected?: boolean >`
  stroke: ${(props) => (props.selected ? "rgb(255, 217, 44)" : "steelblue")};
`;

```

The component should return the following template:

```tsx
<Svg
  onPointerDown={(e: PointerEvent) => e.stopPropagation()}
  onClick={props.click}
>
  <HoverPath d={path} />
  <Path selected={props.data.selected} d={path} />
</Svg>
```


The existing connection can be marked as follows:

```ts
connection.selected = true;
area.update("connection", connection.id);
```

## Synchronization of selected connections

Let's get the selector ready

```ts
const selector = AreaExtensions.selector();
const accumulating = AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl();

AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, selector, { accumulating });
```

Adding a connection to the selector can be done in the following way (for instance, by clicking on the connection):

```ts
selector.add({
  id: connection.id,
  label: 'connection',
  translate() {},
  unselect() {
    connection.selected = false;
    area.update("connection", connection.id);
  }
}, accumulating.active())

connection.selected = true;
area.update("connection", connection.id);
```

Now we'll consolidate all of this into a single component using a straightforward closure-based approach (although other methods are preferable in production code), and pass it as a custom connection component

```tsx
function SelectableConnectionBind(props: { data: Schemes["Connection"] }) {
  return (
    <SelectableConnection
      {...props}
      click={() => {
        selector.add({
          /// ...
        })
        // here should be placed here the code for adding to the selector, as shown above
      }}
    />
  );
}

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    connection() {
      return SelectableConnectionBind;
    }
  }
}));
```
